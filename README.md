# Angular Pokemon Trainer

This app recreates an Pokemon Trainer registration using Angular (16.2.6), Custom Angular Material, and consuming the public API [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Prepare environment

Use of [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended and run `nvm use` in the root of the project to set the Node/NPM version.

For better development experience, install Angular CLI globally with command `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` or `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
